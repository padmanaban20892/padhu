Spring Boot Advantages
1.Simplified & version conflict free dependency management through the starter POMs.
2.We can quickly setup and run standalone, web applications and micro services at very less time.
3.You can just assemble the jar artifact which comes with an embedded Tomact, Jetty or Undertow application server and you are ready to go.
4.Spring Boot provides HTTP endpoints to access application internals like detailed metrics, application inner working, health status, etc.
5.No XML based configurations at all. Very much simplified properties. The beans are initialized, configured and wired automatically.
6.The Spring Initializer provides a project generator to make you productive with the certain technology stack from the beginning. You can create a skeleton project with web, data access (relational and NoSQL datastores), cloud, or messaging support.

Disadvantages:
1.Spring boot may unnecessarily increase the deployment binary size with unused dependencies.
2.If you are a control freak, I doubt Spring Boot would fit your needs.
3.	Spring Boot sticks good with micro services. The Spring Boot artifacts can be deployed directly into Docker containers. In a large and monolithic based applications, I would not encourage you to use Spring Boot

Two number sum
Given an array of integers, return the two numbers whose sum is equal to a given target
For example: array [7, 9, 5, 2, 4, 6]. Target = 15
Output – 9 , 6
Note:-
